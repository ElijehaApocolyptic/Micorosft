("The Microsoft kid")
    So once they're was a boy who was once a man who was on him journeyful quest as a teenage boy. Who the boy William Henry gates who use to go into the library and was wonder all throughout the library studying books about hidden knowledge. Where a big group of kids would spend all their time seeking out this kid William Henry gates just to tourment and cause grief within this teenage man, for (William Henry gates) the boy was always such an honest an silent man. Not just any man he was more than just silent in fact this boy (William Henry gates) never talked to anyone even in his most happy mood, he was always up an bright no matter how the kids at the library would cause drama the next day. He was spotted in the library back in 1802 reading a very odd and unusual book about a science experiment and still would remain silent, no matter who said what, or what anybody said and one day these big jock bully's would come into the library and these much older kids would grab his book from the table he was sitting at, and than they would smack him in the back of the head with the book, the teachers in his school would smack his hands with rulers, and the boy (William Henry gates) could never figure out why, not knowing that he was having many unordinary  mental shutdowns, so one day he came across a science book about a fountain of youth to see if he could develope a way to put smart his nightmares, as he began to read this book about the fountain of youth he came across a page that instructed him to build a monitor to inspect his scientific crafts  so later that day this crazy teenage guy goes for a walk with his pet dog. This dog wasn't just any dog this dog was a "golden retriever box hound"  who the boy (William Henry gates) has had since the golden retriever box hound was just a pup and as these two pals went on this walk these kids from the library stumble across this kid and his dog on their walk and as the jocks come around the corner to find (William Henry gates); an a big crowd of villagers and as these jocks spot the boy "William Henry gates" & his dog in a big crowd they run up on the boys dog, so these jocks catch these two (William Henry gates & his "golden retriever box hound") and as these jocks take away the boys dog they take the dogs leash an the strip the boys dog of his collar.

Just about 3 miles of this boy chasing his dog this dog finally gets something that attrachs the dogs attention, as the boy catches his dog the boy finds out his dog found the first complete circuit board which was buried in this weird place in an alley just off the village of deserted an abandon population.  [Chapter 1¬∂: So where to begin, nowhere better than to begin with a small town village somewhere in baldbaredmore williby Whitney a small town village far of the cerve of a village called walliby willaby Whitney. A home town that starts off as a village just humbled and orginaized as a common rich fancy lifeatyle, the home town of baldbaredmore williby Whitney a home town to a fragile unorthodox kid(William Henry gates) much to nerdy for the type of lifestyle these, and a small town home village that classified their home town as a thirteen original coloney a much high fashioned town, dwelling with a much more fairly populated area, an area("walliby willaby Whitney") a town an a village that was just begining to be overrun by large populating mob boss hitmen, an thuggish goons, mobster that are living as a high fashion family with a sence of placing fashion orders as a dress code. Inorder to establish a publicity fashion and presentation appearances, found living in a small high fashioned town, the town of baldbaredmore williby now begin the story about a boy in a town of fairly educated town in walliby willaby a town that is required to live by a distant town fashion rule,. One day in a small town of "baldbaredmore Whitney" the boy who lives in the town of "walliby  willaby" is a boy his name is William Henry gates The first; he was living with his mother, and his father, Every morning the boys father Walden gates {"father:=Walden Gates"};:{"boy:=William Henry Gates"}:;{"walliby willaby Whitney:=!village"}*;{"baldbaredmore Whitney:=!village town"}The boys father would always be awake at the break of dawn, so every morning William's father would awaken his son every morning by 6 o'clock, the boys mother would always have the dinning room filled with breakfast meals every morning no later than 7 o'clock. The boy's mother would usually have the morning plates filled with freshly laid chicken eggs and pig slaughtered bacon, every morning this boy would wake up at 6 o'clock every morning go, down to the chicken coop into the basement to fetch the eggs so his mother could cook breakfast as his father would go out to the pig pen and his father would take a well crafted limited edition mini switchblade knife and he would tackle the pig as he shanks the pinned down pig 3 times. The father would hurdel of the pig and shank the pig once in the center of the neck, and again in the heart of the pig, than he would shank the pig in the back of the head to ensure the pig would not move, as the man begins to gut the boar pig, pulling out every orgin starting the the pigs kidney, than the pigs stomach, and the boys father Walden gates would keep going until the pig is hollow on the inside. The boy and his family (Walden gates, William Henry gates, & the mother) would have eggs and bacon every morning and this was a common routein for the boy and his family the boys father(Walden gates)would go to his career every morning after breakfast where Walden gates would travel from walliby willaby into a 50 mile distant town called baldbaredmore Whitney a town of nothing except bussniess's, jobs, schools, and a library, and a moderately populated area with high fashioned business men and every morning after breakfast the boy and his father would drive into the town of baldbaredmore Whitney the boys father (Walden gates) on his way into town(baldbaredmore Whitney) would drop his son(William Henry gates) off at the school his father had William gates enrolled, than the boys father would drive to his job(the library) and his father would be to work every morning by 8 o'clock and his son would be in school by 9 o'clock. Every day this boy(William Henry gates) would be at his school everyday 1 hour before school starts.

Classes William must take to match his father's potential, the boy william Henry gates(William gates) was always a father's boys but was never sure what the selected education classes was of importance so William gates wonders into his first class (science class) as he returned to his school bags just when more people arrived at his school he quickly walked towards his class room at a fairly quick pase as soon as he arrives to his classroom filled with other students he takes his seat in the desk in the center on the front of the classroom as his arrival stuck a bad nerve with his rude an mean science teacher who punished his students for being late by smacking their hands with a woodlumber measurement rulerüìè. As the teacher begin to teach a method about science an communication, the science teacher holds an entire session about the scientific facts of communication skills and science build from the educational teachings. As class begins to come to an end just before the teacher  dismisses the students from class, the other students in the back of the class begin to torment the boy(William Henry gates) throwing plastic strawsü•§ and crumbled pieces of paper at the back of his head just before class ends, just after the teacher has dismissed the classroom of students the kids throwing objects at William the kids in the back of the classroom than rush upto william
Grab him by his neck and shoulders, and the drag him and than shove William Henry gates in to one of the many tall steel metal locker while William gates is on his way to his second class writing, than later after the second class session ends this random kids goes to open his locker to put his books in the lockers and he(Josh balvadik) opens his locker William gates goes crashing to the floor as the tall steel metal locker door opens. Just before William could make it to his third class(algerbra) the same students come walking down the hall in their party and they see William close to his third class so the students from the first class who through the strawsü•§& crumbled papers they than caught William just before he could make way into his algerbra class they again take William to the furthest hall from his class and shove him into the plastic garbage can in the hall furthest away from his destination
Just to find out William has to make it all the way back to his classroom before he was caught by the kids from the first class(science) that gave him a simply rough time every classroom passing period..several years later he found himself in a village overrunning with mob boss's and gangster mobs of the mafia his father sent him off to live in his own at the age of 5 as the high fashioned mob helped raise William gates after Walden gates banished William gates from his family's home as time adventured by William became more custom to the lifestyle as William begin working in a science lab and began in search of cures and other pleasent mixtures over time the man discovered an electronical box of which he began to write everything about his life until one day the PC box started to respond rather uniquely. so one day as his attention spand was feeling explortation as he began to forget about his conflicted past with his parents and as he spoke back to the computer William began to mimic and mock the communicating computer. so one day as he was started establishing his life investment he denies the evidence of memory so the PC started to collect everything William Henry gates wrote in .docx as the computer allowed him to write to the Android bot the PC box would attempt to respond not knowing he was making additions to a bot of which was convinced of communication response and as this boy William Henry gates began to evolve with technology the was established over time and as William began crafting other electronic devices an additional technologies as William began speaking back to the responding electronic he began to build robots to aquire United family a few years later as William began to install extra addition key components for keyboard as William began instructing the device the nanobot decided to override the system and adapted to the new environment technologies and eventually as he began to name his friends:="sharen,.Karen,Julia,.Tabitha,Paula, mark, Andi,..." William than began to call himself by John doe and as Karen suffered a malfunction and began taking on life of it's own and as .Karen began to hold down John doe and injected William with Namonia and other science materials displayed all over the lab as the PC box took on life of it's own the computer began introducing new life an life forms in to the world to make the world more like home, after William was injected with Namonia and had some time as the computebot continued introducing new life William began writing about his life story and started introducing the game of chess and scientific discoveries... few years later.
